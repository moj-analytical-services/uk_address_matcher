@dataclass(repr=False)
class SplinkStage(MatchingStage):
    """Probabilistic matching stage built on Splink.

    This stage is usually placed last because it is the only stage that emits a
    score and therefore requires threshold tuning. Earlier deterministic stages
    should remove the obvious high-precision matches first, leaving Splink to
    handle the harder residual cases.

    The stage returns the standard match columns plus two key diagnostics:

    - ``match_weight``: the strength of evidence for the selected canonical
      candidate. Higher is better.
    - ``distinguishability``: the gap in ``match_weight`` between the best
      candidate and the next best candidate for the same messy record. Higher
      means the winner is clearer. ``NULL`` usually means there was only one
      candidate left after blocking.

    Setting ``final_match_weight_threshold=-20`` and
    ``final_distinguishability_threshold=0.0`` is a permissive configuration
    that keeps almost all top-ranked Splink candidates. Raising either
    threshold filters out more weak or ambiguous matches, typically improving
    precision at the cost of recall.

    Args:
        predict_threshold_match_weight: Initial minimum score passed to
            ``linker.inference.predict()``. Lower values retain more candidate
            pairs for later refinement.
        improve_threshold_match_weight: Minimum score considered when applying
            the token-based score adjustment step.
        improve_top_n_matches: Number of top candidate pairs per messy address
            to retain for the token-based score adjustment step.
        improve_use_bigrams: Whether the token-based improvement step should
            use bigrams as well as single tokens.
        final_match_weight_threshold: Minimum ``match_weight`` required for a
            Splink match to be emitted in the final results.
        final_distinguishability_threshold: Minimum distinguishability required
            for a Splink match to be emitted. Set to ``None`` to disable this
            filter.
        include_full_postcode_block: Whether to include a strict full-postcode
            blocking rule when generating Splink candidate pairs.
        include_outside_postcode_block: Whether to include broader blocking
            rules that can generate candidate pairs across postcode boundaries.
        additional_columns_to_retain: Extra columns to keep in the Splink
            predictions and downstream inspection output.
        settings: Optional custom Splink settings object. Leave as ``None`` to
            use the library defaults.
        retain_intermediate_calculation_columns: Retain Splink comparison
            columns needed for debugging and waterfall charts.
